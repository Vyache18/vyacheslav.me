Hello! My name is Slava and I'm IT specialist with 9 years of work experience. I'm interested in three areas: development, management, and, more recently, the media sphere.

If you're interested in short description: here is [my CV]({{ 'assets/pdf/VyacheslavGoryunov_CV.pdf' | relative_url }}) and welcome to [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vyacheslav-goryunov/). 

But if you're interested in a detailed description then I'll tell you about my experiency in each direction. 

## Development
My development journey started in 2013.

- First three years of my career - game development. Unity, C#, databases. In this period I had cooperated with different people and even brought out a few mobile games: arcades, racings and shooters. 
- The next three years - active dipping into commercial adtech development. In the period I had worked with PHP, server administration and high-load development. I developed high-load rotator on PHP, and after that on NodeJS to speed-up that pipeline.
- And the next stage which continues now - the next level adtech without rotators on PHP and NodeJS but on more suitable technology: GoLang. The current system can handle more than 300 thousands of requests per second, parallel making OpenRTB requests, writing statistics in ClickHouse database and actively reaching that with much metrics. 

## Management
My management journey began little lately: in 2017.

- At the beginning I helped my partners in developing of small projects: from browser extensions to Android applications. We didn't have a persistent dev team that's why we worked with freelancers. The cycle looked like: I got a vision from customer; decomposed that; made a development plan; and assigned already decomposed tasks with technical description to freelancers. After that testing and sending a final result to a customer. 
- After that I started developing of my pet-project: [BrainyPlan]({{ '/projects/BrainyPlan' | relative_url }}). Here I did have a small persistent team: articles author, mobile application developer and designer. The lack of stuff was compensated by freelancers, ex.: site developing. 
- And the next period, which also continues now: I'm team lead and tech lead in adtech company. We started with team of three, and now I'm happy to work with six professional developers. There are already serious tasks here, a large client base, the 300 thousand requests per second, the processes and a complex infrastructure of hundreds of servers.

## Media
This direction is very young for me: formal it started in November 2020. Because in November 2020 I've created [my russian YouTube channel about IT]({{ 'projects/YouTube' | relative_url }}).

I'm happy to share my findings and experiency with other people because if any of simple movie would help to solve someone problem, which is a part of something bigger, than that's "bigger" will be closer to completion. And who knows how cool this idea can be ;)
